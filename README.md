This is a website built with AngularJS and Bootstrap that shows the news articles exactly 10 years ago today. Logically, the content on the site changes everyday. It calls the New York Times Article Search API. 

I am rather new to Javascript and even newer to AngularJS. Take a look and let me know what I am doing wrong or if you have any suggestions. Thanks! :)

Possible future improvements: 
- filter the articles so only major articles show up
- sort articles based on number of hits it got at the time
- let the user choose the number of years he/she wants to go back: ex. 30, 40, 50 years
